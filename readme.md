# Todo App

### STATUS : *C.R.U.D.* SAT on 12 Jun 2016

* JS, jQuery & Bootstrap.

* Build A Todo App with full CRUD capability.

### NOTES :

* I attempted to incorporate a [BootstrapToggle](http://www.bootstraptoggle.com/#api) slider in place of my checkbox.  
  - Issue 1: It would work without DYNAMIC implementation.
  - Issue 2: When it's instantiated it does not load the Bootstrap Toggle Script. On refresh, the script runs, and then it works.
  - Needed Fix: How to run the script, once it's been generated.
  - Possible Work Around : Emulating the script logic in my own main.js.
